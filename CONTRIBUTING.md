### Frontend development

Front assets (css/js/images) are handled by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

When you're in development environment (i.e. `http://majoraotastore.dev/app_dev.php/...`), the project is configured to use webpack dev server to serve assets, it means that the project will seems to be broken until you run the following command:
```shell
npm start
```

When you're in production environment (i.e. `http://majoraotastore.dev/...`), the project will use the assets found in `web/assets`, it means that you'll have to run `npm run build` each time you edit an asset file to see the modification in your browser (after refreshing it). 

### Common tasks
```shell
# rebuild the whole database with clean fixtures
make db-rebuild
# update your database schema after adding/removing stuff in your data model
make db-rebuild db-update db-build
# run functional tests
bin/behat
```
