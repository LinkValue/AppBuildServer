### Frontend development

All the assets (CSS/JS) are handled by Webpack.

By default, you'll have to run `npm run build` each time you edit an asset file to see the modification in your browser (after refreshing it).

But you can also use the webpack-dev-server to watch assets modification without needed to rebuild assets or even refreshing your browser.

First, activate the webpack-dev-server support in your `parameters.yml` file:

```yml
# parameters.yml

...

use_webpack_dev_server: true

```

Then run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

### Common tasks
```bash
# rebuild the whole database with clean fixtures
make db-rebuild
# update your database schema after adding/removing stuff in your data model
make db-rebuild db-update db-build
# run integration tests
bin/behat
```
